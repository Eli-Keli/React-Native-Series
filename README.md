#  React Native Project Series  

Welcome to my **React Native Project Series** repository! üéâ  

This repository documents my journey as I learn and grow as a React Native developer by building various projects. From beginner-friendly apps to more complex solutions, this series showcases consistent learning, improvement, and experimentation.

## About  

I started this journey to:  
- Strengthen my mobile development skills.  
- Learn by building real-world projects.  
- Share my progress with the developer community.  
- Encourage others to start their own learning journey!

## Tech Stack  

Here are the tools and technologies I‚Äôm using throughout this series:  
- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile apps.  
- **TypeScript**: For writing scalable, type-safe code.
>**Might use Expo**: for rapid prototyping and testing

---

## Goals  

1. Build 10+ React Native projects by [specific timeline, e.g., 3 months].  
2. Learn advanced mobile development concepts.  
3. Gain hands-on experience with React Native libraries and tools.  
4. Contribute code examples to the developer community.

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have cloned this repository ```git clone https://github.com/Eli-Keli/React-Native-Series.git``` and ```cd React-Native-Series/projectname``` before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
