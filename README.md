## Tech Stack  
Here are the tools and technologies I used throughout this series:  
- **Expo**: For rapid prototyping and development workflow.  
- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile apps.  
- **TypeScript**: For writing scalable, type-safe code.  
- **Formik**: For form state management and validation.  
- **Expo Router**: For navigation and routing in Expo apps.  
- **Clerk**: For authentication (SMS OTP, user management).  
- **State Management**: Using React state and context for app logic.  
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable logic across components.  
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Reanimated**: For smooth and performant animations.  
- **React Native Gesture Handler**: For handling complex gestures.  
- **React Native Section Alphabet List**: For displaying and navigating lists with alphabetical section headers, similar to contact lists in messaging apps.
- **Gifted Chat**: For building chat UIs.  


## Goals  

1. Complete 10+ React Native projects within the next few months.  
2. Master advanced mobile development concepts and best practices.  
3. Gain practical experience with popular React Native libraries and tools.  
4. Share code examples and insights with the developer community.  
5. Foster continuous learning and improvement through hands-on projects.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have cloned this repository using  
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Eli-Keli/React-Native-Series.git
> cd React-Native-Series/projectname
> ```
> Replace `projectname` with the specific project folder you want to work on.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (preferably the latest LTS version).
- Install [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) globally if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```

- For iOS development, install Xcode and its command line tools.
- For Android development, install Android Studio and set up the Android SDK.

### Step 3: Start the Project

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser/terminal. You can then:

- Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device (available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)).
- Or, run the app on an emulator/simulator by selecting the appropriate option in the Expo Developer Tools.

### Step 4: Explore and Modify

- Browse the project files and start making changes.
- Hot reloading is enabled by default, so your changes will reflect instantly in the app.

### Step 5: Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues, try clearing the cache:

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

- Check the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) or open an issue in this repository for help.
